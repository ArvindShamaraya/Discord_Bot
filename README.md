Bot Integration Project
Overview
This project implements a bot that integrates with a messaging platform. The bot listens for messages, checks if they start with a specified bot ID, and responds accordingly based on predefined commands and responses.

Features
Bot ID Recognition: The bot responds only to messages that start with a specified bot ID.
Dynamic Responses: The bot can handle static and dynamic responses, such as generating a random number for a "roll dice" command. There will be more commands to come, this is just the start.
Flexible Command Handling: Commands and their responses are predefined in the code for easy maintenance and scalability.

DISCLAIMER: This is purely for fun and a simple side project.
